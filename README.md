# Project Dependency Visualizer

**Project Dependency Visualizer** is a web-based tool built with **Node.js** and **D3.js** to visualize and explore the dependencies within a project. It helps developers better understand how different modules or components in their project are interconnected.

## Features
- **Interactive Dependency Graph**: View and explore dependencies between project modules/components using a dynamic, force-directed graph.
- **Node Highlighting**: Click on any node to highlight its connected dependencies, making it easy to track relationships.
- **Built with Node.js and D3.js**: Server-side powered by Node.js, and the graph is rendered using the D3.js library.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt it to visualize dependencies in your own project.

## Tech Stack
- **D3.js**: For rendering the interactive graph
- **Node.js**: For serving project data and logic
